# Introduction to Minecraft Modding (Player wise)
Hey there! Welcome to the MC Modding Introduction page, which aims to help you better understand or learn how to play and manage mods in Minecraft. 


# **PART 1 - Setting Up**
Before doing **ANYTHING**, you must keep a few things in mind:

## The Basics
### I. Performance & Stability
Minecraft is known to be rather resource-intensive and unoptimized. Adding mods makes the game harder to run, and sometimes on low-end computers, outright unplayable. You may have heard of mods such as Optifine or Sodium/Lithium, which are both mods made to help improve the performance of the game. 

You are **RECOMMENDED** while playing Modded to have **AT LEAST** 4-8GBs of RAM allocated to Minecraft for it to run well. Even if your computer is quite beefy, performance issues will still arise. For both low and high-end computer players, we recommend you refer to this  [Github Page](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) for further information/mods to help optimize your game performance if you so need. 

### II. Mod Management
Updating and managing mods is quite a hassle. So to lessen the headaches, here are a few things you can do.
1. Use a Launcher that is not the Vanilla Minecraft Launcher, like [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/), [CurseForge](https://download.curseforge.com/), or [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/).
2. Always check if you are using the right mod with the correct: mod loader, mod version, and mod Minecraft version

</details>


4. Check if the mods have any dependencies that they require. This is usually found in its description, Relations tab, or files tab.

> Some mods may not have included their dependencies in the two locations shown above, but rather in the Mods Description

</details>


5. Use [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) or [Curseforge](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/search?page=1&class=mc-mods&sortType=2&pageSize=20) to download mods from. Other sites are sketchy, not easy to use, or arenâ€™t reliable or popular.
> [!WARNING]
> Please be vigilant when downloading mods, as they may include viruses and such that the moderators of the websites may not have caught.

6. Modders have frequently either stayed on a version indefinitely or only updated to specific versions. These version include as of 8/5/23: 1.7.10, 1.8.9, 1.12.2, 1.16.5, 1.18.2, 1.19.2 and the current latest version 1.20.1. 


## Setting Up Mod Loaders
Now that we have the basics out of the way let's start Modding! To be able to use mods in Minecraft, we'll be using Mod Loaders. There are currently two main Mod Loaders, them being [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/), and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/). Let's first set up a basic mod profile.

> [!NOTE]
> Other mod loaders include [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en/), [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/), [Rift](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rift), [LiteLoader](http://www.liteloader.com/), and [Risugami's Modloader ](https://ftb.fandom.com/wiki/Risugami's_Modloader) (DISCONTINUED). We will not be going over these mod loaders as most of them are inactive, discontinued, in heavy development, or not very popular.

### Let's first set up a basic mod profile.
